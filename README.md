# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-YOLOv8n-Model-With-Attention-Layers
This project uses the YOLOv8n model with Space-Time Mixing Attention (STMix), Polarized Self-Attention (PSA), and Dual Multi-Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) to classify glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI scans, providing a lightweight solution for real-time brain tumor detection.
